# Student Score Prediction

The dataset have two columns . they are
  * Time (in hours) 
  * Score

## Linear Regression 
  As the dataset contains label ,we can apply supervised machine learning methods here .
  Linear regression is best suited for this dataset as we have to predict the score (dependent variable) depending on Time (independent variable). 
  
  We have evaluated the performance of the model by
  1. Root Mean Square Error
  2. Mean Absolute Error
